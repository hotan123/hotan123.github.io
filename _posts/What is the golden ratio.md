# **What is the golden ratio?**

1. The golden ratio *(symbol is the Greek letter "phi" )*  is a special number approximately equal to 1.618 .

In MATHEMATICS, two quantities are in the **golden ratio*  if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. Expressed algebraically, for quantities *a* and *b* with *a* > *b* > 0, where the Greek letter Phi represents the golden ratio.

It is an IRRATIONAL NUMBERwith a value of:

The golden ratio is also called the **golden mean** or **golden section** .

Other names include **extreme and mean ratio**, **medial section**, **divine proportion**, **divine section** (Latin: *sectio divina*), **golden proportion**, **golden cut**, and **golden number**.

3. Why is Golden Ratio so important in nature?

The importance of the Golden Ratio has been somewhat exaggerated over the years in the popular media. The scientific evidence for many of these examples of this ratio and the Fibonacci series is doubtful at best.
When we look at phyllotaxy or the branching of plants, the golden ration is far from the picture. It is true that they exhibit patterns from the Fibonacci sequence, but not the golden ratio. Remember the golden ratio appears as the limit of adjacent terms at *infinity,* which is far from the truth for biologicals systems. An explanation for this arrangement has been proposed with the help of **L-Systems** or **Lindenmeyer grammars.** The mathematics is very involved and beyond most biologists. However, it has been noticed that leafs are actually arranged in a spiral and this explains a lot, as detailed below.
Other alleged instances of the golden ratio have hardly been proved. They have been used to study attractiveness, smiles and even the failing heart. To attribute the Fibonacci sequence to us having one face, two arms and five fingers seems to be a case of finding what you would like to be true.
 However, the Equiangular spiral is actually ubiquitous in nature and the Fibonacci spiral is a close approximation. Among its myriad interesting properties (*spira mirabilis),* is the fact that every segment of the curve is similar to any other like in a circle. That explains the spiral shape of the *Nautilus* shell or the Ram's horn. Since the curve is self similar everywhere, an organism that grows maintaining its shape but increasing in size only would turn out to be an equiangular spiral (or a circle). So the shells of molluscans are an indicator that a simple rule of growth produces such complex structures.
Coming back to leaves, the fact that they are arranged in an equiangular spiral allows us to directly work out that the Fibonacci sequence would come up in phyllotaxy. Similarly, for florets of the sunflower. They are arranged in two opposite whorls of spirals, and the Fibonacci sequence peaks out of them on analysis.

Therefore, many instances of the golden ratio are either bogus or secondary to simple rules leading to spiral structures.
Kindly do look up D'Arcy Thomson's classic "On Growth and Form", for a more detailed exposition, already a century old but as valid today as ever.
