When my students come to me and say “I want to get a PhD”, we have a long **discussion** about what that means. For most people, I would say the answer is ‘no’. Getting a PhD is not the **route** to making lots of money or even gaining a lot of **prestige**. It is the required degree for most academic researchers. In many ways it is an **apprenticeship** to learn how to do research. And write. There is lots and lots of writing: Papers, **proposals**, reviews, it goes on and on. If writing is a **chore**, a PhD is not the best use of your time. Furthermore, I meet many smart students who are just not PhD material. To be a good academic researcher you need certain skills. Writing and communications is one. You must love to dive into the details and never tire of **chasing down** loose threads. You must also be willing to work long hours because research is not really a 9–5 job. You can make a lot more money doing something else, so you should be ready that even if you are successful, you will be in the upper middle class - comfortable but never rich. In fact, it will take years to overcome the financial burden caused by spending another 4–5 years as a poorly paid grad student, when you could have been earning money and retirement funds.

You also need to consider where the jobs are. My wife, a history professor, will no longer take PhD students because she knows there are very few university jobs. And many of those university jobs are “**contingent**” positions with few benefits, low pay, and no long term contract. This is one of the ways that college administrators try to respond to people complaining about the high cost of college - by making a class of employee that is not paid a decent wage. Many good universities will not do that. So you must be realistic about your job prospects. If there are only a few **faculty** positions in your field and you want to be university faculty, you must be a superstar to get a job. Even very talented people will fall short. If you are open to other possibilities, especially working outside of academe, then the picture is brighter.

If you want to get a PhD, it almost has to be **beyond** reason - just something that you will never be happy unless you do it. That was me. I wanted to be a scientist from when I was a kid. I did it and I enjoy the fun parts. But I am also a professor at Big State U, with all of the **malarkey** that it **entails**. When I have something come together and I understand it and realize that I may be the first to figure it out - it is an **incomparable** rush. But is is also rare. Most of my work is stuff that I need to do to have these **infrequent** moments.
