I am from Mongolia. I have been here in Sydney for 4 years already. I want to share my experience with you guys.

1. Education: The reason why i came to Australia was to get better education in English. English is primary language in Australia. Unfortunately, the tuition fee is way higher than that in Mongolia. I study at TAFE (government), which focuses more on practices rather than theories.
2. Safety: Australia is relatively safe place to live in. The police has gun but people have no gun (very **strict** gun law). **Regardless of** who you are, you are protected by the law.
3. Weather: The country is so hot. The weather is like extremely hot, very hot, hot and little bit hot. Australians say that Australia is cold in winter. But usually, Mongolian summer is colder than Australian winter.
4. Working in Australia: Students have right to work 40 hours fortnightly. Unlimited hours during holiday times. Most Asian students think that their English is not good enough to work for Aussie companies so they **tend to** be hired by their **compatriots**. I am cleaning cinemas, where i get paid 26.36$ per hour. However, Asian students work at restaurants getting about 12–13$ per hour. That is like a joke. My Chinese roommate works as web-designer and getting less money than me who is doing **vacuuming**.
5. Cost of living. This is the saddest part of my answer. This country is really really expensive. Renting a room outside of Sydney is more than 180–200$ per week. I will tell you a funny story that happened to me: Before going to Australia, i was browsing the internet to investigate as to how much it costs to rent a room in Sydney. On the internet, it said like around 180–200$. So i thought it is very cheap compared to its salary. But when i arrived in Australia, i realized that in Australia, everything is paid weekly, not monthly like in Mongolia. So the payment rises 4 times because 1 month = 4 weeks. So my dream of getting rich is gone. lol

I assume you are planning to come to Australia. I would like you to know few things before coming here.

- Stop smoking immediately. Here one pack of cigarettes is more than 20$.

- Visit dentist in your country. It might **ruin** your finance if you visit dentist in Australia: That depends on your **insurance**. Most basic private insurance (which you will be heavily **urged** to take by the age of 31) allows having two general cleaning sessions a year for free, plus covers a lot, unless you have really serious issues.

- Learn as many things as possible in your country such as driving: This is excellent advice which many ignore. In most States, you have to prove that you have had 120 hours of **supervised** driving experience by someone with an Australian driving licence. Most recently arrived people wouldn’t know anybody who would do this for free. (Normally its your parents or friends of your parents). Paying somebody to do this costs $50 an hour minimum, so a driving license would cost about $6,000. I don’t know what it takes to convert a Mongolian licence into an Australian one, but Australia is a very, very expensive place to learn to drive if you don’t know anyone. And being able to drive makes a huge difference. Its a big country, small population, so public transport doesn’t go everywhere.

- Australians are friendly people. I suggest you to work with Australians.

- As soon as you come here, apply for **certificates** for the skills required.

- Keep at least 1000$ in your bank account, so that in **emergency**, you will be able to go back to your country.

- I would say that never ever hired by someone who was not born in Australia. They will most likely **over-exploit** you.

- Do not stick to your **compatriots** when you spend thousands of dollars to come here to start a new life.

Enjoy your time in Australia. Good luck!!!
