The only advantage (for students) Poland has compared to other european countries is that the life is relatively cheap. But for the rest ?

The country is possibly the most **xenophobic** and **racist** in Europe. Keep in mind that it’s not **catastrophic** either, but you will most probably be **confronted** to it at a point or an other if you’re a student with a student’s life, going out partying, especially if you’re not “looking European” (with the exception of East Asians, who aren’t that much targeted). (*[Ở đây dùng targeted thay vì targetted](http://www.future-perfect.co.uk/grammar-tip/is-it-targetted-or-targeted/)*)

Students jobs aren’t **necessarily** easy to find, as employers almost always look for people speaking polish. The rare, better paid ones where knowing english can be valued (working on **infolines** for **corporations**, giving english classes …) are so heavily **concurrence** already among **bilingual** Poles that it’s hopeless to even try getting one. Plus they aren’t well paid *at all* - the wages **are adapted to** the cheap life in the country, which means you’ll earn about 3–4 times less than in France/Germany/UK etc for a similar job.

The weather isn’t fantastic. Left that alone, the main student cities such as Warsaw or Kraków have important **issues** with air pollution, breaking pretty much all the time the air quality **norms** during winter, or **flirting** with it. In Warsaw this year, the lack of wind during most of December caused the air quality to drop about twice lower than the dangerous standard, and my little sister, along with the rest of the children, wasn’t allowed to play outside at school. It’s not China either I imagine, but it can affect your quality of life.

The universities are poor and poorly known. Then again, if you want a **generic** degree that you can get anywhere else anyway, it’s no big deal.

I mean I think I have to be honest about my own country ; as somebody who left Poland to study abroad for these exact reasons (and pretty much all my friends who could and were **ambitious** did the same), it appears to be quite clear.

On the bright side, Poland is cheap and **arguably** safer than most of his European **counterparts**. But that’s it.

Is Poland a bad place to study in as a foreigner ? I guess not, you have everything you need to study there happily, but that’s true for almost all European countries anyway. That being taken into account, Poland is still probably the worse country around, with the **exception** of some other eastern european states … It’s not a fantastic place to study in as a pole, so if you’re a foreigner, it’s **definitely** not the best choice.
