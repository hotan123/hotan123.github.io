I saw my older friend at the university of medicine and pharmacy in HCM on facebook last day. He had a challenge 30 days reading and reflexing his books. I literally do admire him about everything he did. Everything always has so many purposes. Few projects he did below:

- Project FIND X for the teenagers in Quang Nam around the ages of 12-16. (About teaching soft skills, learn, ... )
- Reading and reflexing what he read from the books. (I talked about it).
- He maybe got the IELTS score of about 7.0 or more. What a fantastic thing! I told me he learnt by reading, talking with friends, video, books, audios...
- In 2 years grade 11 & 12, he got a lot of awards. Like the pride third and second in the National Chemistry Olympiad, attended the TST exams choose the team Viet Nam to haunt the international olympiad.
- Now he is in the second at his university. And a few years later, when he finished his study, he may study abroad in Europe, more detailly England. 
- He also has a group to practise speaking skills with his friends.
- He has received the Sunflower scholarship for the excellent students in the university.
- And so on...

And I will try to do my best like him this year. Hopefully, that will become true. And this is my list tasks to do:

- 30 days challenge for reading and reflexing what books I read. And also upload to my blog. 
- Learning English 3 hours per day.
