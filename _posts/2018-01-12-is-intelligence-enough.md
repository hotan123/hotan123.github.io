If you want to know who is the most important person in the group, notice the one who has the least body movements.
Human behavioral studies suggest that a person who loses their cell phone experiences a panic similar to a near death experience.
People ain't afraid of abuse, cheating, backstabbing, and shit, they are afraid of you being genuinely for them.
If you want to know about the man observe him when he is alone and if you want to know about the woman observe her when she is with people.
When in a public place, if someone keeps looking at you so much it’s becoming frustrating, just look at their shoes…like, for a long time; this will make them feel so uncomfortable, they'll probably back off.
An instant change in mood from happiness to sad indicates that you’re missing someone.
People who are solving puzzle games on a daily basis are becoming good decision makers in real life.
People who spend a lot of time on the internet are more likely to be depressed, lonely and mentally unstable.
When people are being watched, they behave better. And the illusion of being watched works, too. It was enough to hang a picture of human eyes in a self-service cafeteria so that more people began to collect their dishes.
People speak and think negative opinions about others to boost their self-confidence and they believe their thoughts are correct and logical.
People are more likely to cry at night because lack of sleep makes emotions hard to control.
Obesity is contagious; you’re more likely to be overweight if you have a lot of overweight friends.
Losing something makes you twice as miserable as gaining the same thing makes you happy.
Appearance plays an important role even when voting during elections. Maturity and physical attractiveness of politicians were most important for voters’ choice (unconsciously, of course).
Not all risks are the same. The same person can fearlessly jump with a parachute, but be afraid of his boss. Or to train tigers, but feel embarrassed when talking to a pretty woman.
Some people marry because they feel love. Others marry to have sex, or else their religious beliefs will make them feel guilty.
If you’re too fast for people, they’ll assume you’re slow.
Everybody wants to go to Heaven but nobody wants to die for the free trip!
Because “beliefs” are usually conclusions reached by people who are too lazy to think for themselves, it’s safe to say—there’s only a handful of truly “free thinkers” in the world.

People with low self-esteem are likely to humiliate others. In one study, people who were told that the results of their IQ test were poor expressed more racial and religious prejudices, than those who reported higher results.
Most people sincerely believe that their negative opinions about others are true, and have no connection with them and their self-confidence. In fact, the humiliation of others helped them restore their own self-esteem.
The behavior of people is affected by bodily sensations and feelings. There is a strong association between “heaviness” and such features as “importance” and “seriousness”.
