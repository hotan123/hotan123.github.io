Dinosaurs lived in a world that was much warmer, with more oxygen than now, what was weather like? More violent? Hurricanes, tornadoes? Some **articles** talk about the **asteroid** **impact**, but not about what normal life was like for the dinosaurs. (and not necessarily "hurricanes", but great storms).

Trong bài có một cấu trúc ngữ pháp sai là **built off of** và nên sửa lại thành **built on**.

> **Build off of** is an incorrect phrase. One **builds on** things, such as earlier achievements. One does not “*build off of*” anything.

>
> Medical researchers **build on** previous knowledge from the literature to make scientific breakthroughs and develop cures for diseases.
>
> We need to **build on** what we already have.

*Oxygen, not so much. But the supercontinents back then could really have **amplified** weather conditions.*

The level of oxygen wasn't really that much of a factor. Oxygen levels were higher because plants were sucking all of the carbon dioxide out of the air and **trapping** the carbon into coal and oil at the time while breathing out oxygen and raising the levels up to about 30%. (It's 21% or so now). That much higher level would have made fires way more dangerous in dry areas like grasslands with lots of fuel. Large fires can **contribute** some to weather, but they usually don't **amplify** storms in general.

The biggest influence was continental structure. We had two different supercontinent-type land formations back then, Pangaea around 300 million years ago broke into two big chunks, Laurasia and Gondwana, during the time of the dinosaurs.

Now very generally speaking, the more you **pack** **land** **into** one area and ocean into the other, the greater the general **impact** on weather... and with supercontinents leaving **gigantic stretches** of ocean pretty much wide open, you're going to get this to happen. This is because hurricanes **feed off** **of** warmer water and **shrink** when they cross land, and when there's more warm water, there's bigger hurricanes or typhoons (and this is why Pacific storms are often larger than Atlantic ones).

Other storms can get amplified too. Nor'easters (the big storms we get here on the North-Eastern coast of North America) build off of differences in air pressure which are caused by differences in heat level. Larger masses of solar-heated continuous land mean greater regional heating, and that can translate to differences in regional pressure colliding with each other and generating much more powerful localized storms.

There's a number of other factors including sea depth (shallower seas warm up more), mountains that **deflect** currents of air, ocean currents (that help to **convey** warm and cold weather and equalize temperatures), and distribution of land versus water at the equator where the most solar energy is focused. All of this stuff is why it's hard to talk about specifics back then.

But in general, you could expect to get truly massive storms crossing over the coasts of the supercontinents in this altered world.
