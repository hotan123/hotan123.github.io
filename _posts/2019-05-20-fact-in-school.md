[**What are some 'facts' still being taught in school, that have been proven to be false?**](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-facts-still-being-taught-in-school-that-have-been-proven-to-be-false)

These are all based on my school experience . So, here we go :

- The Holocaust was the **genocide** of just 6 million **Jews** *and no others*; that’s false. The Holocaust was the genocide of 6 million Jews *and also* 5 million other **innocent** **civilians** that the Nazis viewed as “**undesirable**”, including Jehovah’s Witnesses, Romani, Slavs, Poles, disabled persons, the mentally ill, and homosexuals. Although Nazis most **thoroughly** and systematically went after the Jews that doesn’t diminish the **remainder** of their crimes.
  - **genocide** /ˈjenəˌsīd/ : Cuộc diệt chủng, sự tiêu diệt của một dân tộc.
  - **Jews**: Người Do Thái
  - **innocent** /ˈinəsənt/: Ngây thơ, thật thà, trong sạch, vô tội. (**ingenuous**, **harmless**, **innocuous**, **unacquainted**)
  - **civilian** /səˈvilyən/: công dân
  - **undesirable** /ˌəndiˈzīrəbəl/: not wanted or desirable because harmful, objectionable, or unpleasant.
  - **Nazis** : Đức quốc xã
  - **thoroughly** /ˈθɝː.ə.li/:  completely, very much (**I thoroughly enjoyed the performance*)
  - **remainder** /rɪˈmeɪn.dɚ/: the part of something that is left after the other parts have gone, been used, or been taken away.

- Henry Ford’s Model T was the first **automobile** invented. This is also false. The German engineer Karl Benz invented the first working automobile by 1885. Ford’s Model T began **mass** **production** in 1908. Henry Ford also didn’t personally invent the Model T. Rather, his company simply **manufactured** the car which was the first **affordable** automobile. What Henry Ford **contributed** was the assembly line, a dramatic redesign of the factory layout that fully realized the **potential** of electric power distribution.
  - **automobile**  /ˈɑː.t̬ə.moʊ.biːl/, /ˈɑː.t̬oʊ-/, auto: relating to car.
  - **manufacture**  /ˌmæn.jəˈfæk.tʃɚ/:  to produce goods in large numbers, usually in a factory using machines.
  - **affordable** /əˈfɔːr.də.bəl/: not expensive, able to be bought or rented by people who do not earn a lot of money. (**cheap**, **valueless**)
  - **contribute** /kənˈtrɪb.juːt/: to give something, especially money, in order to provide or achieve something together with other people, to write articles for a newspaper, magazine, or book.![img](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8453626563d15b3fa0114320350366e1.webp)

- School teaches you that Neil Armstrong said: ‘*one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind*.” In actuality, he correctly **recited** the scripted line “*one small step for* a man, one giant leap for mankind.” Low space broadcast and TV sound **fidelity** gave rise to this **misconception**.

- The Great Wall of China can’t be **seen from outer space**. Since it’s thin and has the same colour and texture as the surrounding landscape, the reality is that the world’s longest **defensive** **fortification** is nearly impossible to see with **the unaided eye** in low-Earth orbit.

- George Washington had wooden teeth. In reality, woods was never used in Washington’ **denture** nor was it commonly **utilized** by dentists of that era.

- Chameleons only change colours to camouflage themselves. In reality, lizards also change colours to communicate, particularly as part of mating behavior, and to regulate their body temperatures. Males may change to bright colours to attract females and other chameleons change colours to warn others of danger.

- Columbus wanted to prove the world was round. In reality, most educated people in Europe - and particularly the sailors - knew the world was round. They just figured (correctly) that Columbus had been mistaken in the distance he thought it would take to reach China and the Indies. He also didn’t discover America as in the United States of *America* . He never even set foot on mainland North American soil and died without even realizing that he had discovered an entirely new continent.

- Vikings wore horned or winged helmets. Simply put, they did not wear them. This is quite a big misconception of the Norse invented long after the fact.

- There is no gravity in space. In reality, small amounts of gravity can be found everywhere in space. Gravity is what holds the moon and human-made satellites in orbit around Earth. Everything in space is falling *together*, while on Earth only one thing is falling.

- Ben Franklin flew a kite and discovered electricity.

  ![img](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cd7eee281ef61e0a0a9cae2788eb9cfd.webp)

  The story goes that Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity by flying a kite with a metal key attached to it during a lightning storm. When the kite was struck by lightning, the charged passed down the string and into the key. There is no real evidence to suggest that this story ever actually took place. In fact, many today argue that had it really happened, Franklin would have likely died from the electrical shock. It makes for a fun story, though.

- Albert Einstein failed in Mathematics.

  ![img](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a3596b690d1fa0357bb43e76a2b37188.webp)

  Albert Einstein did not fail mathematics classes (never "flunked a math exam") in school. Upon seeing a column making this claim, Einstein said "I never failed in mathematics... Before I was fifteen I had mastered differential and integral calculus."

  Einstein did however fail his first entrance exam into the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School (ETH) in 1895, when he was two years younger than his fellow students but scored exceedingly well in the mathematics and science sections, then passed on his second attempt.

- The Great Wall of China can be seen from space.

  The Apollo astronauts confirmed that you can't see the Great Wall of China from the Moon. In fact, all you can see from the Moon is the white and blue marble of Earth.

- Bulls are enraged by the color red.

  Bulls are not enraged by the color red, used in capes by professional matadors. Cattle are *dichromats,* so red does not stand out as a bright color. It is not the color of the cape, but the perceived threat by the matador that incites it to charge.

- Thomas Edison invented the light bulb.

  ![img](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0989a103c9514174c1cba69f4b37937d.webp)

  Edison actually bought the patent for an incandescent bulb from the widow of a fellow inventor named Heinrich Goebel. Before Edison had his lucky breakthrough, around 22 other inventors had toyed around with incandescent bulbs.

- An apple fell on Sir Isaac Newton's head, thus helping him to discover gravity.

  ![img](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d23efea324380cdfa34dd51b964aaccb.webp)

  Legend has it that a young Isaac Newton was sitting under an apple tree when he was bonked on the head by a falling piece of fruit, a 17th-century “aha moment” that prompted him to suddenly come up with his law of gravity. In reality, things didn’t go down quite like that. Newton, the son of a farmer, was born in 1642 near Grantham, England, and entered Cambridge University in 1661. Four years later, following an outbreak of the bubonic plague, the school temporarily closed, forcing Newton to move back to his childhood home, Woolsthorpe Manor. It was during this period at Woolsthorpe (Newton returned to Cambridge in 1667) that he was in the orchard there and witnessed an apple drop from a tree. There’s no evidence to suggest the fruit actually landed on his head, but Newton’s observation caused him to ponder why apples always fall straight to the ground (rather than sideways or upward) and helped inspired him to eventually develop his law of universal gravitation.

- The World Map

  This is all false. This is completely unrealistic. The world looks nothing like this.

  The problem is that you can’t perfectly put a spherical design on a flat plane without messing up the proportions. In the flat world map, the farther a country is from the equator, the larger it will be shown. You see Greenland on the map above? It looks roughly the same size as Africa, right? 

  Well, it’s not. The area of Greenland is 2 million square kilometers, while the area Africa is 30 million square kilometers. **Africa is 15 times as big as Greenland**, but they are shown to be the same size.
