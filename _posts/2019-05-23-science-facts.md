# **What are the most fascinating science facts?**

- Diamond as **superconductor**
- Helium is 24% of our universe, but it is a **non-renewable**
- Existence of god **particle** [(Higgs boson)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson)

- Humans can distinguish between up to a trillion smells.

- There’s an **asteroid** in the solar system that actually has rings (like Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun, does).
- There are **nerves** in a narwhal’s **tusk**.
- Bees [sense a flower's electric field](http://www.nature.com/news/bumblebees-sense-electric-fields-in-flowers-1.12480) and use it to find **pollen**.

- There's a planet where it rains glass, [sideways](http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1312/). This is because of the **intense** winds on this planet; the wind speeds on the planet can actually reach as high as *5,400 miles per hour,*which is actually around 2 kilometers per second (or over seven times faster than the speed of sound).

- A Mars-sized object **crashed** into Earth 4.5 billion years ago, **chipping off** a **chunk** of rock that became the moon. This is also what made Earth’s axis tilt a little bit (23.5 degrees, to be precise).

- Atoms are almost entirely empty space, and if you somehow actually removed all the empty space from the atoms that make up all the humans on Earth, the remaining mass could fit inside **one** sugar cube. And that means all 7.6 billion (almost) of us.
